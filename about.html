      <h2>Where You Belong</h2>
      <p>
        At Truth Church, you're not just a visitor — you're family. In a world that often feels distant and divided, our doors open wide with warmth, joy, and deep connection. Whether you're searching, healing, growing, or simply looking for a place to call home — we’ve been waiting for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are a Christ-centered, people-focused family committed to truth, love, and transformation. Here, your story matters. Your questions are welcome. Your gifts are needed. You will laugh, cry, grow, and thrive alongside people who genuinely care for you.

        </p>

      <p>
        From uplifting worship to empowering teachings, community outreach to prayerful fellowship, every part of Truth Church is designed with you in mind. We’re not building a crowd — we’re nurturing a community. A place where grace flows freely, and every heart finds its rhythm in God's divine purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Come as you are. Find your place. Walk with us. Truth Church is more than a gathering — it’s a home where destiny unfolds.
